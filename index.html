          <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>I’m a developer based in Cincinnati, OH. My love for coding was sparked after taking a basic web development course over a decade ago. Since then, the majority of my career has been focused in the fields of Communications and Media, while I dabbled in website administration in my free time. It wasn’t until I became frustrated with a website and wanted to build it better that I rediscovered code.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>My skills in Communications and design allowed me to see the endless possibilities in development. From sites to applications, anyone can have their own little space in the digital universe. As a problem-solver and stickler for details, I enjoy challenges and providing my clients with clean, organized code. The freedom and flexibility of development has allowed me to tap into my best skills and truly have fun building something every day.</p>

            <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
            <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

            <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
